# Vizs of Relationship within GDPs and Olympic Performance
This is my first visualization project aiming to find out whether and how a countryâ€™s performance in Olympic Games is related to its GDP, with the use of Tableau. After building different sorts of charts and performing analysis on them, it is found that both the GDP and GDP growths of a country do not quite correlate with its Olympic performance, except for USA and China, which are the outliers in GDPs and own the most models in Olympic. The charts are concluded in the dashboard shown below:

Frankly speaking, this is not a really well-designed dashboard and the insights are a bit insufficient with only 4-5 plots displayed. But throughout the process of building the charts and the dashboard, I have learnt to utilize different functionalities in Tableau, such as creating parameters to switch one chart to another, utilizing duali line plots and adjusting the layout in the dahsboard to make a visual borders between the graphs shown in the dashboard, etc. This project has also ingrained the basic Tableuau knowledge in me, which later on becoming beneficial for me to better understand the terms and definitions in the Tableau world and granting me a Tableau Desktop Specialist Certification eventually.
